HackDuke 2018 project. The goal of this project is to help students remember when assignments are due. They take a picture of the assignment, and this program finds the due date, class, and assignment name, and displays it on the website for them. In the future, we would link it to their Google Calendar and add a reminder, but we weren't able to add that yet.

## How to use

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install python 3.5 or above
3. Install pip
4. Install all necessary packages (the ones at the top of json_io.py)
5. Register a project with console.cloud.google.com (this is really hard and I don't remember how to do it anymore).
6. Include a path to the json verifying your identity.
7. Run `ipconfig` to figure out how to access the website.
8. Open a terminal and run `python json_io.py`.
9. In your browser, navigate to your ip, with `xip.io:5010` at the end. I.e. `10.193.65.204.xip.io:5010`
10. Enjoy!
